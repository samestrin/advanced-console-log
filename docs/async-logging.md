## Why Use Async Logging?

- **Improved Performance**: The async methods do not block the event loop, making them better suited for scenarios where multiple log operations are performed rapidly.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Since the file operations are handled asynchronously, the main thread is not held up by I/O tasks, reducing latency and improving overall responsiveness.
- **Flexibility**: By enabling `useAsyncLogging`, users can switch to async logging methods seamlessly without changing their code structure.

## Summary of the Differences

| **Feature**               | **Regular Logging Methods**            | **Async Logging Methods**                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**             | Synchronous (blocks the event loop)    | Asynchronous (does not block the event loop)        |
| **Method of Execution**   | Direct function call                   | `setImmediate` to defer execution                   |
| **File Write Operations** | Uses `fs.appendFileSync` (synchronous) | Uses `fs.appendFile` (asynchronous)                 |
| **Use Case**              | Suitable for low-throughput scenarios  | Best for high-throughput, non-blocking requirements |
